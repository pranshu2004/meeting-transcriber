# Meeting Transcriber & Summarizer

This project was created to help me **transcribe and summarize meetings**, including both:

- **Online meetings** (by recording system audio)
- **In-person or hybrid meetings** (by switching to microphone input instead)

Everything here is built with **free and open source software** and designed to run **entirely offline**, including transcription and summarization. This is especially helpful for privacy-sensitive contexts like interviews or internal team discussions.

---

## Features

- Record system audio (or switch to mic)
- Transcribe using OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- Summarize using [Mistral-7B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) via `llama-cpp-python`
- ðŸ’» Runs on CPU (no GPU required) and fully offline, open-source, hackable


---

## Environment Used

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- **Python**: 3.11
- **Virtual environment**: created with `venv`
- **Hardware**: CPU-only (no GPU)

---



## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install system dependencies

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following system tools installed:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meeting-transcriber.git
cd meeting-transcriber
```
These are used to capture system audio (`parec` from PulseAudio), convert audio formats (`ffmpeg`), and list available devices (`pactl`).

### 2. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meeting-transcriber.git
cd meeting-transcriber
```

### 3. Create virtual environment

```bash
python3.11 -m venv audio_venv
source audio_venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download models

- Whisper (automatic on first run)
- Mistral 7B Instruct (Q4\_K\_M)
  - Download from [TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-GGUF)
  - Place the `.gguf` model in the root directory and update the path in `summariser.py`

---

## How to Run

### Step 1: Record Audio

```bash
python record_system.py
```

- Records until you press `Enter`
- Make sure the source monitor is correct (edit `record_system.py`, update the `parec -d` device if needed)
- Use `pactl list sources short` to find the correct monitor

### Step 2: Transcribe Audio

```bash
python transcriber.py
```

- Outputs to `transcript.txt`

### Step 3: Summarize Transcript

```bash
python summariser.py
```

- Outputs batchwise bullet-point summaries to `final_summary.txt`

## Future Work / Improvements

- **Speaker diarisation** (label different speakers)
  - Might require some level of user input
- **One main orchestrator script** for the full flow
- Make it more usable for non-devs (e.g., GUI or CLI prompts)
- No hardcoding: auto-detect system source instead of manually editing `record_system.py`
- Maybe deploy it as a simple app, browser extension, or Electron GUI
- Possibly explore real-time meeting assistant extensions

## Contributions

Pull requests welcome â€” this is a very rough but functional start. If you have ideas for better UX, diarisation, efficient streaming, real-time handling, etc., feel free to contribute.
